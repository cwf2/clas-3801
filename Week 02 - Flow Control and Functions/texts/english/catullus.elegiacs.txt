Though outspent with care and unceasing grief, I am withdrawn, Ortalus, from the learned Virgins, nor is my soul's mind able to bring forth the sweet fruit of the Muses (so much does it waver amidst ills: for but lately the wave of the Lethean stream washes with its flow the poor, pale foot of my brother, whom the land of Troy crushes beneath the Rhoetean shore, stolen from our eyes. [Never again will I hear you speak,] never again, O brother, more lovable than life, will I see you. But surely I will always love you, always will I sing elegies made gloomy by your death, such as the Daulian bird pipes beneath densest shades of foliage, lamenting the lot of slain Itys. – Yet amidst sorrows so deep, O Ortalus, I send you these verses recast from Battiades, lest by chance you should think that your words have slipped from my mind, entrusted to the wandering winds, as it was with that apple, sent as furtive love-token by the wooer, which leapt out from the virgin's chaste bosom; for the hapless girl forgot she had placed it beneath her soft robe – when she starts at her mother's approach, out it is shaken: and down it rolls headlong to the ground, while a tell-tale flush bears witness to the girl's distress.

He who scanned all the lights of the great firmament, who ascertained the rising and the setting of the stars, how the flaming splendour of the swift sun was darkened, how the planets disappear at certain seasons, how sweet love with stealth detaining Trivia beneath the Latmian crags draws her away from her airy circuit: he that same Conon saw me, a lock of hair from Berenice's head, in the celestial light, gleaming brightly, which she outstretching graceful arms promised to all of the gods, when the king, magnified by his recent marriage, had gone to lay waste the Assyrian borders, bearing the sweet traces of nightly contests, in which he had borne away her virginal spoils. Is Venus abhorred by new brides? And are the parents' joys turned aside by feigned tears, which they shed copiously within the threshold of the bedchamber? Their groans are untrue, by the gods I swear! This my queen taught me by her many lamentings, when her bridegroom set out for stern warfare. Yet, when deserted, you did not grieve the widowed couch, did you, but the tearful separation from a dear brother? How care consumed your marrow, sad deep within! Such that, your whole bosom being agitated, and your senses being snatched from you, your mind wandered! But in truth I have known you great of heart ever since you were a little maiden. Have you forgotten that noble deed, by which you gained a royal marriage, than which none dared other deeds bolder? Yet what grieving words you spoke when bidding your bridegroom farewell! Jupiter! how often with sad hand [you wiped] your eyes! What mighty god changed you? Was it that lovers are unwilling to be long absent from their dear one's body? Then did you promise me to the whole of the gods on your sweet consort's behalf, not without blood of oxen, if he should be granted safe return. In no long time he added captive Asia to the Egyptian territory. For these reasons I, bestowed amidst the celestial host, by a new gift fulfil your ancient vow. Unwillingly, O queen, did I quit your brow, unwillingly: I swear to you and to your head; if anyone swears lightly, may he bear a suitable penalty: but who may claim himself equal to steel? Even that mountain was swept away, the greatest on earth, over which Thia's illustrious progeny passed, when the Medes created a new sea, and the barbarian youth sailed its fleet through the middle of Athos. What can locks of hair do, when such things yield to iron? Jupiter! may the whole race of the Chalybes perish, and whoever first began to seek the veins beneath the earth and invent the hardness of iron! Just before severance my sister locks were mourning my fate, when Ethiop Memnon's brother, the winged steed, beating the air with fluttering wings, appeared before Locrian Arsinoe, and he bearing me up, flies through aethereal shadows and lays me in the chaste bosom of Venus. Zephyritis herself had dispatched him as her servant, a Greek settler on the Canopian shores. For it was the wish of many gods that the golden crown from Ariadne's temples stay fixed, not alone in heaven's light, but that we also should gleam, the spoils dedicated from your golden-yellow head; when moist with weeping I entered the temples of the gods, the goddess placed me, a new star, among the ancient ones. For touching the Virgin's and the cruel Lion's gleams, hard by Lycaonian Callisto, I turn westwards, a guide before the slow-moving Bootes who barely sinks into the vast ocean. But although the footsteps of the gods press upon me in the night, and the daytime restores me to the white-haired Tethys, (grant me your grace to speak thus, O Rhamnusian virgin, for I will not hide the truth through any fear, even if the stars revile me with ill words, yet I will unfold the pent-up feelings from truthful breast) I am not so much rejoiced at these things as I am tortured by being forever parted, parted from my lady's head, with whom I, in all ointments having not a share, drank many thousands when she was still a virgin.

    Now do you, whom the gladsome light of the wedding torches has joined, yield not your bodies to your desiring husbands nor throw aside your robes and bare your nipples, before your onyx cup brings me delightful gifts, your onyx, you who seek the dues of chaste marriage-bed. But she who gives herself to foul adultery, ah! may the light-lying dust responselessly drink her vile gifts, for I seek no offerings from folk that do ill. But rather, O brides, may concord always be yours, and constant love ever dwell in your homes. But when you, O queen, while gazing at the stars, will propitiate the goddess Venus with festal torch lights, let not me, your own, be left lacking of unguent, but rather gladden me with large gifts. Why do the stars hold me back? would that I become a royal tress, that Orion might gleam next to Aquarius.

O dear in thought to the sweet husband, dear in thought to his sire, hail! and may Jove augment his good grace to you, Door! which of old, they say, did serve Balbus benignly, while the old man held his home here; and which on the contrary, so it is said, did serve grudgingly after the old man was stretched stark, you doing service to the bride. Come, tell us why you are reported to be changed and to have renounced your ancient faithfulness to your lord?

    No, (so may I please Caecilius to whom I am now made over!) it is not my fault, although it is said so to be, nor may anyone impute any crime to me; albeit the fabling tongues of folk make it so, who, whenever anything is found not well done, all clamor at me: “Door, yours is the blame!”

    It is not enough for you to say this by words merely, but so to act that everyone may feel it and see it.

    In what way can I? No one questions or troubles to know.

    We are wishful: be not doubtful to tell us.

    First then, the virgin (so they called her!) who was handed to us was spurious. Her husband was not the first to touch her, he whose little dagger, hanging more limply than the tender beet, never raised itself to the middle of his tunic: but his father is said to have violated his son's bed and to have polluted the unhappy house, either because his lewd mind blazed with blind lust, or because his impotent son was sprung from sterile seed, and therefore one greater of nerve than he was needed, who could unloose the virgin's belt.

    You tell of an excellent parent marvellous in piety, who himself urinated in the womb of his son!

    But Brixia says that she has knowledge of not only this, placed beneath the Cycnean peak, through which the golden-hued Mella flows with its gentle current, Brixia, beloved mother of my Verona. For she talks of the loves of Postumius and of Cornelius, with whom that one committed foul adultery.

    Someone might say here: “How do know you these things, O door? you who are never allowed absence from your lord's threshold, nor may hear folk's gossip, but fixed to this beam are accustomed only to open or to shut the house!”

    Often have I heard her talking with hushed voice, when alone with her serving girls, about her iniquities, quoting by name those whom we have spoken of, for she did not expect me to be gifted with either tongue or ear. Moreover she added a certain one whose name I'm unwilling to speak, lest he uplift his red eyebrows. He is a lanky fellow, against whom some time ago was brought a grave law-suit over the spurious child-birth of a lying belly.

Because you, oppressed by fortune and bitter calamity, sent me this letter written with tears, that I might bear up shipwrecked you tossed by the foaming waves of the sea, and restore you from the threshold of death; you whom neither sacred Venus suffers to repose in soft slumber, desolate on a lonely couch, nor do the Muses divert with the sweet song of ancient poets, while your anxious mind keeps watch: – I am grateful that you call me your friend, and seek here the gifts of the Muses and of Venus. But so that my troubles may not be unknown to you, Manlius, and so that you not think that I hate the duty of host, hear how I myself am engulfed in the waves of fortune, and do not further seek joyful gifts from a wretched one. In that time when the white toga was first handed to me, and my flowering age was passing its delightful spring, much and enough did I sport: nor was the goddess unknown to us who mixes bitter-sweet with our cares. But my brother's death plunged all this pursuit into mourning. O brother, taken from my unhappy self; you by your dying have broken my ease, O brother; all our house is buried with you; with you have perished the whole of our joys, which your sweet love nourished in your lifetime. With your loss, I have dismissed wholly from mind these studies and every delight of mind. So then, because you write, “it is shameful for Catullus to be at Verona, because here someone of the better sort warms up his frigid limbs on a desolate couch;“ that, Manlius, is not shameful; rather it is a sorrow. Therefore, forgive me if I do not bestow on you these gifts which grief has snatched from me, because I am unable. For the fact that there is no great store of writings with me arises from this, that we live at Rome: there is my home, there is my hall, there my time is passed; here but one of my book-cases follows me. As it is thus, I would not want you to think that we do this from ill-will or with a mind not open enough, because ample store is not forthcoming to either of your desires: of my own accord would I grant both, had I the wherewithal.

I cannot conceal, goddesses, in what way Allius has aided me, or with how many good services he has assisted me, lest the flight of time through ages of forgetfulness cover with night's blindness this care of his. But I shall tell it to you, and you in time to come declare it to many yousands, and make this paper, grown old, speak of itAnd let him be more and more noted when dead, nor let the spider aloft, weaving her thin-drawn web, carry on her work over the neglected name of Allius. For you know what anxiety of mind twofold Amathusia gave me, and in what manner she overthrew me, when I was burning like the Trinacrian rocks, or the Malian fount in Oetaean Thermopylae; and my sorrowful eyes did not cease to dissolve with continual weeping, or did my cheeks to be dampened with sad showers. As the transparent stream gushes forth from the moss-grown rock on the airy crest of the mountain, which, when it has rolled headlong prone down the valley, softly wends its way through the midst of the populous parts, sweet solace to the wayfarer sweating with weariness, when the oppressive heat cracks the burnt-up fields agape: or, as to sailors tempest-tossed in black whirlpool, there comes a favourable and a gently-moving breeze, implored by prayer now to Pollux, now to Castor: of such kind was Allius' help to us. He laid open my closed field with a wide path; he gave us a home and he gave it to our mistress, in which we both might exercise our loves in common. There with gracious gait my bright-hued goddess betook herself, and pressed her shining sole on the worn threshold with creaking sandal; as once came Laodamia, flaming with love for her husband, to the home of Protesilaus, – a home begun in vain – not yet had a victim appeased the lords of the heavens with sacred blood. May nothing please me overmuch, Rhamnusian virgin, that is undertaken rashly against the will of those lords! How the thirsty altar craves the pious blood Laodamia was taught by the loss of her husband, being compelled to abandon the neck of her new spouse before one winter and another had come, in whose long nights she might sate her eager passion, so she could live despite her broken marriage-yoke. The Parcae decreed that this would not be long distant, if her husband went a soldier to the walls of Ilium. For then with Helen's rape Troy had begun to summon the Argive chiefs to itself; Troy (accursed!) the common grave of Asia and of Europe, Troy, the bitter ashes of heroes and of every noble deed, that also lamentably brought death to our brother. O brother taken from unhappy me! O delightful light taken from an unhappy brother! together with you is buried all our house, together with you have perished all our joys, which your sweet love nurtured during life. Whom now so far away Troy, obscene, baleful Troy, an alien land, holds in far-distant soil laid not among familiar tombs or near the ashes of his kindred. There, it is said, hastening together from all parts, the Greek youth forsook their hearths and homes, lest Paris enjoy his abducted trollop with freedom and leisure in a peaceful bed. Such then was your case, loveliest Laodamia, to be bereft of husband sweeter than life and breath; the tide of love swallowing you in so great a current bore you off into its steep abyss, as the Greeks say Pheneus near Cyllene drains off the soil from the rich swampland. Once the falsely-born son of Amphitryon is heard to have dug this soil, having cut through the marrow of the mountain, at the time when he knocked down the Stymphalian monsters with sure arrows at the command of his inferior lord, so that the gate of heaven might be pressed by a greater number of deities, and Hebe might not remain in long virginity. But deeper than that abyss was your deep love which taught you then, untamed, to bear the yoke. For not as dear to the parent consumed with age is the head of the late-born grandchild an only daughter rears, who, [an heir] found at last for the ancestral wealth, scarcely having brought his name into the public records, casts off the impious joys of mocking kinsmen and stirs away the vulture from the whitened head; nor so much does any dove rejoice in her snow-white consort, which they say is always plucking kisses with her nibbling beak: more shamelessly than a woman who is especially passionate. But you alone surpassed the great frenzies of these, when you were once united to your yellow-haired husband. Worthy to yield to her in no respect or in little, my light brought herself into my embrace, round whom Cupid, often running here and there, gleamed radiantly in his saffron tunic. Although she is not content with Catullus alone, we will bear the rare intrigues of our coy lady, lest we may be too much a bother, after the manner of fools. Often even Juno, greatest of heaven-dwellers, boiled with flaring wrath at her husband's fault, knowing the many intrigues of passionate Jove. Yet it is not fair to compare men with the godsbear up the ungrateful burden of a trembling father. After all she was not handed to me by a father's right hand when she came to my house fragrant with Assyrian perfume, but she gave me her stolen favors in the wondrous night, taken away from the embrace of her own husband. Therefore it is enough if to us alone she gives that day which she marks with a whiter stone.

    This gift to you, Allius, completed in what verse I can, is in return for many services, so that this day and that, and other and other of days may not touch your name with flaking rust. To this the gods will add the many gifts, which Themis once used to bring to the pious of old. May you be happy, both you and your life's-love together, and your home in which we have sported, and its mistress, and he who first gave us earth takes it away, from whom all my good fortunes were first born, and lastly she whose very self is dearer to me than all these, – my light, who living, living is sweet to me.

---

Don't wonder why no woman, Rufus, wants to place her tender thigh beneath you, not even if you tempt her with the gift of a rare robe or with the delights of a crystal-clear gem. A certain ill tale injures you, that you bear housed in the valley of your armpits a grim goat. This everyone fears. It's no wonder: for it is an exceeding ill beast, with whom no fair girl will sleep. Therefore, either murder that cruel plague of their noses, or cease to marvel, "Why do they fly?"

---

No one, says my lady, would she rather wed than myself, not even if Jupiter himself sought her. Thus she says! but what a woman says to a desirous lover ought fitly to be written on the breezes and in running waters.

---

If ever anyone was deservedly cursed with an atrocious goat-stench from armpits, or if limping gout did justly gnaw one, it is your rival, who occupies himself with your love, and who wondrously has obtained each these ills from you. For as often as he takes his pleasure, he just as often takes vengeance on both; herself he prostrates by his stink, he is slain by his gout.

---

Once you used to say you knew only Catullus, Lesbia, that you would not hold Jove before me. I loved you then, not only as a fellow his mistress, but as a father loves his own sons and sons-in-law. Now I do know you: so if I burn at greater cost, you are nevertheless to me far viler and of lighter thought. How can this be? you ask. Because such wrongs drive a lover to love the more, but less to respect.

---

Cease to wish you well deserve anything from anyone, or to think anyone can become pious. All things are unpleasant, it is of no avail to have done deeds of kindness, but rather it wearies me, wearies me and proves the greater ill: so with me, whom no one oppresses more heavily nor more bitterly than he who a little while ago held me his one and only friend.

---

Gellius had heard that his uncle used to scold anyone who spoke of or practised the delights of love. That this should not happen to him, he kneaded deeply his uncle's wife herself, and turned his uncle into a Harpocrates. He did whatever he wanted; for now, even if he boned his uncle, the uncle wouldn't say a word.

---

Now is my mind brought down to this point, my Lesbia, by your fault, and has so lost itself by its devotion, that now it cannot wish you well, were you to become most perfect, nor can it cease to love you, whatever you do.

---

If there is any pleasure in a man's recalling the good deeds of the past, when he knows that he is pious and has not violated any sacred trust or abused the divinity of the gods to deceive men in any pact, great store of joys awaits you during your length of years, Catullus, from this thankless love of yours. For whatever people can say or do well for someone, such have been your sayings and your doings, and all your confidences have been squandered on a thankless mind. So then why do you torture yourself further? Why don't you strengthen your resolve and lead yourself out of this and, since the gods are unwilling, stop being miserable? It is difficult suddenly to set aside a love of long standing; it is difficult, this is true, no matter how you do it. This is your one salvation, this you must fight to the finish; you must do it, whether it is possible or impossible. O gods, if it is in you to have pity, or if ever you brought help to men in death's very extremity, look on pitiful me, and if I have lived my life with purity, snatch from me this canker and pest! Ah! like a numbness creeping through my inmost veins it has cast out every happiness from my breast. Now I no longer pray that she may love me in return, or (what is not possible) that she should become chaste: I wish but for health and to cast aside this foul disease. O gods, grant me this in return for my piety.

---

Rufus, believed by me a friend, in vain and worthlessly, (in vain? yes, and in fact at an ill and grievous price) you have thus stolen upon me, and burning my innards, ah! snatched from wretched me all our good? you have snatched it, alas, you cruel venom of our life! alas, you plague of our friendship.

---

Gallus has brothers, one of whom has a most charming spouse, the other a charming son. Gallus is a nice man: for he joins together their sweet loves, so that the nice girl beds with the nice boy. Gallus is a foolish man not to see that he is himself a husband who as an uncle shows how to cuckold an uncle.

---

But now I grieve that the pure kisses of a pure girl have mingled with your filthy spit. But in truth you will not come off with impunity; for every age will know you, and Old Lady Fame will tell who you are.

---

Lesbius is handsome: why not so? whom Lesbia prefers to you, Catullus, and to your whole family. Yet this handsome one can sell Catullus and his family if he can find three acquaintances he can gain greet with a kiss.

---

What shall I say, Gellius, how those rosy-red lips have become whiter than winter snow, when you leave home in the morning and when the eighth hour stirs you from a gentle nap amid the long day? Something is certain: perhaps Rumor whispers true that you are devouring the well-grown tenseness of a man's middle? So for certain it must be! the ruptured guts of poor little Victor and your lips marked with what was lately-drained cry it aloud.

---

Could no one in this great people, Juventius, be a nice man you could fall in love with except for this guest of yours, paler than a gilded statue, from the dying town of Pisaurum? He who now has your heart, whom you dare to place before us; and you know not what crime you commit.

---

Quintius, if you want Catullus to owe you his eyes, or another thing dearer than his eyes, if such there is, do not snatch from him what is much dearer to him than his eyes, or what is dearer than his eyes.

---

Lesbia in her husband's presence says the utmost ill about me: this gives the fool the greatest pleasure. Mule, you perceive nothing! If she had forgotten about us and were silent, she would be all right: now becasuse she snarls and scolds, not only does she remember, but, what is far more to the point, she is angry. That is, she is enflamed and is speaking.

---

Chommodious Arrius would say, whenever he wanted to say commodious, and for insidious hinsidious, and then hoped that he had spoken with accent wondrous fine, when aspirating hinsidious to the full of his lungs. I believe that his mother, his free uncle, his maternal grandfather and grandmother all spoke thus. When he was sent to Syria, everyone's ears were rested, hearing these words spoken smoothly and slightly, nor after that did folk fear such words from him, when suddenly is brought the horrible news that th' Ionian waves, after Arrius had come there, no longer are Ionian, but are now the Hionian Hocean.

---

I hate and I love. Why I do this, perhaps you ask. I know not, but I feel it happening and I am tortured.

---

Quintia is lovely to many; to me she is radiant, tall, and straight. Each of these qualities I grant, but deny the whole of these is loveliness: for there is no charm, not a grain of salt in so great a body. Lesbia is lovely, for not only is the whole of her most beautiful, but she has stolen all the Venus-charm from everybody together.

---

No woman can say truly that she has been loved as much as you, Lesbia, have been loved by me: no trust in any pact has ever been found so great as was that on my part in the love of you.

---

What is he doing, Gellius, who has an itch with mother and sister and stays up all night with tunics cast aside? What is he doing, who does not allow his uncle to be a husband? Do you know the weight of crime he undertakes? He undertakes, O Gellius, so much as neither furthest Tethys nor Oceanus, father of nymphs, can cleanse: for there is no crime which can go further, not even if with lowered head he swallowed himself.

---

Gellius is thin: why not? He who lives with so good a mother, so healthy and so beauteous a sister, and who has such a good uncle, and a world-full of girl cousins, why would he cease to be skinny? who if he touched nothing but what is not lawful to touch – you will find ample reason why he is skinny.

---

Let there be born a Magus from the unspeakable coupling of Gellius and his mother, and let him learn the Persian art of divination. For if Persia's impious religion is true, a pleasing Magus ought to be begotten from a mother and son, so that, when the chant has been learned, he may worship gods while melting the fat innards in the sacred flame.

---

For no other reason, Gellius, did I hope for your faith to me in this our unhappy, this our desperate love, (not because I knew you well or thought you constant or able to restrain your mind from a shameless act), but because I saw this girl whose love kept knawing at me was neither your mother nor your sister. And although I have had many mutual dealings with you, I did not believe this case to be enough cause for you. You considered it enough: so great is your joy in every kind of wrongdoing in which there is some vice.

---

Lesbia forever speaks ill of me nor is ever silent about me: I'll be damned if Lesbia doesn't love me! By what sign? because mine are just the same: I exsecrate her constantly, yet may I be damned if I do not love her in sober truth.

---

I am not over anxious, Caesar, to please you greatly, or to know whether you are a white or a black man.

---

Mentula fornicates. Of course a mentule fornicates! This is what they say – the pot itself gathers the vegetables.

---

My Cinna's Zmyrna finally, after the ninth harvest it was begun, and after the ninth winter it was published, when Hortensius meanwhile five hundred thousand [lines] in one [year] Zmyrna will be sent to the curving waves of innermost Satrachus, hoary ages will roll out Zmyrna long hence. But Volusius' Annals will die at Padua itself, and will often furnish loose wrappings for mackerel. May the short works of my comrade remain in my heart; as for the people, let them rejoice in bloated Antimachus.

---

Calvus, if anything pleasing or welcome from our grief can have an effect on silent graves, then with its longing we renew old loves and weep friendships once lost, surely Quintilia does not mourn her premature death as much as she rejoices in your love.

---

So may the Gods love me, I did not think it made any difference whether I smelled Aemilius' mouth or his arse. In no respect is the latter cleaner, the former filthier; as a matter of fact, his backside is cleaner and better – for it comes without teeth. His mouth has teeth a foot and a half long, gums truly like an old wagon-box, and besides, he usually has a maw like the split twat of a she-mule pissing in the summer heat. This man has sex with many girls, and makes himself out to be charming, and is not condemned to the mill [to drive] the mule? Any girl who would touch him we would think could lick the arse of a diseased hangman.

---

What can be said to you, if to anyone, stinking Victius, is said to wind bags and fools. For with that tongue, if the occasion should arise, you could lick arses and farmers' boots. If you want to destroy us altogether, Victius, yawn: you will accomplish what you want altogether.

---

I stole from you, while you were playing, honeyed Juventius, a kiss sweeter than sweet ambrosia. But I bore it off not unpunished; for more than an hour I remember I was nailed to the top of a cross, while I purged myself [for my crime] to you, nor could any tears in the least remove your cruelty. For as soon as it was done, you washed your lips with many drops, and wiped them off with every finger, lest anything contracted from our mouth remain, as though it were the filthy spittle of a piss-wet whore. Besides, you have handed wretched me over to spiteful Love, nor have you ceased to torture me in every way, so that for me that kiss is now changed from ambrosia to be harsher than harsh hellebore. Since you award such punishment to wretched lover, never more after this will I steal kisses.

---

Caelius and Quintius, the flower of the Veronese youth, madly in love with Aufilenus, madly in love with Aufilena – the one with the brother; the other with the sister. This is, as one would say, true brotherhood and sweet friendship. To whom shall I incline the more? Caelius, to you; for your single devotion to us was shown by its deeds, when the raging flame scorched my marrow. Be happy, Caelius, be potent in love.

---

Through many nations and through many seas borne, I come, brother, for these sad funeral rites, that I may give the last gifts to the dead, and may vainly speak to your silent ashes, since fortune has taken yourself away from me. Ah, poor brother, undeservedly snatched from me. But now receive these gifts, which have been handed down in the ancient manner of ancestors, the sad gifts to the grave, drenched with a brother's tears, and for ever, brother, hail and farewell.

---

If anything was entrusted in a pledge of silence by a friend whose inmost loyalty of spirit is known, you will find that I am one of those rightfully devoted, Cornelius, and think that I have become a Harpocrates.

---

Come, Silo, either return me my ten thousand sesterces, and then be to your content surly and boorish: or, if you like the money, please stop being a pimp – and being surly and boorish.

---

Do you believe that I could curse my life, she who is dearer to me than are both my eyes? I could not, nor if I could, would my love be so desperate: but you and Tappo make a monstrosity out of everything.

---

Mentula tries to climb Mount Pimpla: the Muses with their forks chuck him headlong down.

---

When you see an auctioneer with a comely lad, what do believe other than that he longs to sell himself?

---

If ever something happens that you long for and want and is unhoped for, this is genuinely pleasing to the soul. And thus is it pleasing to us and far dearer than gold, that you have returned, Lesbia, to longing me, you have returned to me, longing and without hope, you brought yourself back to us. O day of whiter note! Who lives more happily than I alone, or who can name things greater to be wished for in this life?

---

If, Cominius, by the judgment of the people your white hair made filthy by unclean practices should perish, to be sure I do not doubt that first your tongue, hostile to goodness, cut out, will be given to the greedy vulture, the crow will gorge your eyes, gouged out, down his black throat, the dogs will gorge down your entrails, the wolves your remaining members.

---

My life, you declare to me that this love of ours will be an everlasting joy between us. Great Gods! grant that she may promise truly, and say this in sincerity and from her soul, and that through all our lives we may be allowed to prolong together this bond of holy friendship.

---

Aufilena, good professional girls are always praised: they receive their pay for what they intend to do. Because you promised me – which was a lie – you are unprofessional; because you do not give and often bring [home the pay], you do wrong. Either to do it is honest, or not to have promised was chaste, Aufilena: but to steal what was given by deceiving, proves you worse than the greedy whore who prostitutes herself with her whole body.

---

Aufilena, that a bride live content in her husband alone is praise of exceptional praise: but it is preferable to lie beneath any lover you choose, rather than as mother to bring forth brothers [cousins] out of your uncle.

---

He is a lot of man, Naso, and he who descends with you is not a lot of man: Naso you are a lot – and sexually submissive.

---

In the first consulate of Pompey, Cinna, two used to frequent Mucilla: now again made consul, the two remain, but to each one has accrued a thousand. The seed of adultery is fruitful.

---

With his estate not falsely is Mentula of Firmum said to be rich, which has everything in it of such excellence, game preserves of every kind, fish, meadows, plowland and beasts. In vain: the yield is overcome by the expense. Therefore I grant that he is rich, while everything is lacking. Let us praise the estate, while its owner is a needy man.

---

Mentula has something like thirty acres of meadow land, forty under cultivation: the rest are as the sea. Why can he not surpass Croesus in wealth, he who in one estate possesses so much? Meadow, arable land, immense woods, and open fields and marshes, even to the uttermost north and to the Ocean sea! All things great are here, yet is the owner most great beyond all; not a man, but in truth a mentule mighty, menacing!

Often seeking, my mind hunting how I could send to studious you the poems of Battiades, whereby I might soften you towards us, and you might not try to send hostile weapons at my head all the time – I see now that this effort was undertaken by me in vain, Gellius, and that our prayers to this end were of no avail. Your weapons against us we will ward off with our cloak; but, transfixed with ours, you will pay the punishment.
