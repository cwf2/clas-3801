    "Steganography is the art of hiding a message in plain sight, a form of \"security through obscurity.\" It takes advantage of the fact that we are trained to disregard most of the information around us and focus our attention on what we assume to be relevant. For example, \n",

    "  - \"noise\" in an image may actually encode meaningful data\n",

    "To read more about the history and science of steganography, you can start with the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography), which has a number of neat examples. For a recent real-world case, [listen to the story](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-friday-edition-1.4528357/this-painting-is-actually-a-bitcoin-puzzle-worth-more-than-40k-and-someone-finally-solved-it-1.4529176) of this painting, whose colours and design encoded the key to a bitcoin wallet worth $50,000.\n",

    "In this lab, we'll work in groups to extract seemingly random data from a couple of images and reconstruct the hidden message this data conceals. Digital images are a great **carrier** signal for steganography. Colour photos in particular contain massive amounts of data; tiny variations in pixel values, far below the threshold of our attention, can be used to represent **payload** information like text, data, or even a completely different image.
