    "You can compute expressions with a calculator or type string concatenations with a word processor. You can even do string replication easily by copying and pasting text. But expressions, and their component values—operators, variables, and function calls—are the basic building blocks that make programs. Once you know how to handle these elements, you will be able to instruct Python to operate on large amounts of data for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good to remember the different types of operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, and `**` for math operations, and `+` and `*` for string operations) and the three data types (integers, floating-point numbers, and strings) introduced in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few different functions were introduced as well. The `print()` and `input()` functions handle simple text output (to the screen) and input (from the keyboard). The `len()` function takes a string and evaluates to an int of the number of characters in the string. The `str()`, `int()`, and `float()` functions will evaluate to the string, integer, or floating-point number form of the value they are passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, you will learn how to tell Python to make intelligent decisions about what code to run, what code to skip, and what code to repeat based on the values it has. This is known as *flow control*, and it allows you to write programs that make intelligent decisions."
